# Audio-Enhancer-RNN
A batch script for noise removal from audio or video files. It is compatible for most audio and video formats. It is an implementation of the RNNoise model to be used directly in the Windows terminal.

**All files related to the RNNoise model, found in** */rnnoise_windows* **, are not mine. I just compiled them to be used in Windows. There you can find the original [README.md](/rnnoise_windows/README) that references the paper that describes the algorithm.**
