# Audio-Enhancer-RNN
A batch script for noise removal from audio or video files. It is compatible for most audio and video formats. It is an implementation of the RNNoise model to be used directly in the Windows terminal.

**The RNNoise model files I used were cloned from [this repository](https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/rnnoise). I simply compiled them to be used in Windows. There you can find referenced the original paper that describes the algorithm.**

I will briefly explain how I compiled them to be used in Windows if you are interested. I will do so for completeness of the explanation of how to install and use this tool.
